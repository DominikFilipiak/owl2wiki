Generating Semantic Media Wiki Content from Domain Ontologies
========

Automatic OWL ontology conversion to articles in Semantic Media Wiki system. Our implemented prototype converts a branch of an ontology rooted at the user defined class into Wiki articles and categories. The final result is defined by templates expressed in the Wiki markup language. The tests show that our solution can be used for fast bootstrapping of Semantic Media Wiki content from OWL files. More details can be found [here](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1275/swcs2014_submission_5.pdf). Written for research purposes at Poznań University of Technology. Tested with DMOP ontology.
